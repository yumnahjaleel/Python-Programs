### A brilliant way to bridge the gap between high-level code and low-level hardware is to build a 16-bit CPU Emulator (Fetch-Decode-Execute Cycle).

The SimpleCPUEmulator.py program simulates how a processor actually works at the Digital Logic level. 
It implements basic registers, an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) for the math, and a control unit that decodes binary-style instructions.
