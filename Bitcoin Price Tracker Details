Bitcoin Price Alert
 ->To run this, you will need the requests library. You can install it via terminal using: pip install requests

🚀 Features
Real-time Tracking: Fetches live market data for Bitcoin (and other assets).
Automated Alerts: Notifies the user via console (or email) when a price threshold is crossed.
Error Handling: Robust API request management to handle network dips or rate limiting.
Customizable: Easily change the asset, currency, or check frequency.

🛠️ Installation
1. Clone the repository:
-> git clone https://github.com/yourusername/crypto-price-tracker.git cd crypto-price-tracker
2. Install dependencies: This project requires the requests library.
-> pip install requests

📖 Usage
1. Open main.py (or your script name).
2. Update the my_target variable to your desired alert price.
3. Run the script:
  python main.py

🏗️ Architecture
The project follows a simple Request-Response cycle:
Input: User defines a target price.
Process: Script polls the CoinGecko API every 30 seconds.
Logic: Comparison operator checks if Current Price <= Target Price.
Output: Alert triggered in the terminal.

🧪 Future Improvements
[ ] Add support for SMS notifications via Twilio.
[ ] Implement a GUI using Tkinter or PyQt.
[ ] Track multiple coins simultaneously using a config file.
[ ] Export price history to a PostgreSQL database for trend analysis.

How it Works
 ->The API Request: The script sends a "GET" request to a URL. The server responds with a JSON object (a dictionary in Python).
 ->The Loop: The while True loop keeps the script running indefinitely.
 ->The Wait Time: time.sleep(30) is crucial; if you ping a server too many times per second, they will block your IP address.
